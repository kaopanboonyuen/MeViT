## Abstract

Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in remote sensing, focused on classifying every pixel within an image for various land use and land cover (LULC) applications. This project introduces **MeViT** (Medium-Resolution Vision Transformer), a novel approach tailored for Landsat satellite imagery of key economic crops in Thailand, including para rubber, corn, and pineapple. Our method enhances Vision Transformers (ViTs) by integrating medium-resolution, multi-branch architectures, optimized for semantic segmentation. The revised **MixCFN** (Mixed-Scale Convolutional Feedforward Networks) block within MeViT incorporates multiple depth-wise convolution paths, effectively balancing performance and efficiency. 

Through extensive experimentation on Thailand's satellite scenes, **MeViT** has demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving a precision of 92.22%, recall of 94.69%, F1 score of 93.44%, and mean IoU of 83.63%.

## Key Features

- **Medium-Resolution Vision Transformer**: Enhances standard ViTs by introducing a multi-branch architecture optimized for medium-resolution data.
- **Revised MixCFN Block**: Integrates multiple depth-wise convolution paths to efficiently capture multi-scale local information.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves top metrics in semantic segmentation tasks on Landsat imagery, outperforming existing models.
